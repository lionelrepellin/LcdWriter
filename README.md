LCD Writer
===

Your mission is to create the logic to show numbers on a LCD screen. This screen has a grid of 3x3, every compartment can contain one space, a low dash, or one pipe. 
For example (here by using a point instead of space)

```
._.   ...   ._.   ._.   ...   ._.   ._.   ._.   ._.   ._.
|.|   ..|   ._|   ._|   |_|   |_.   |_.   ..|   |_|   |_|
|_|   ..|   |_.   ._|   ..|   ._|   |_|   ..|   |_|   ..|

```
Example: 910 

```
._. ... ._.
|_| ..| |.|
..| ..| |_|

```

A command line program will allow to execute the result of your work.
